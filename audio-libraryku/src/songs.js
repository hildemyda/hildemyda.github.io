Oh my, my
Oh my, my love
I take one look at you

You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found
Somethin' so out of the ordinary
You got me kissin' the ground of your sanctuary
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

Hopeless hallelujah
On this side of Heaven's gate
Oh, my life, how do ya
Breathe and take my breath away?
At your altar, I will pray
You're the sculptor, I'm the clay

Oh my, my

You're takin' me out of the ordinary
I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine

Somethin' so out (Out) of the ordinary (Ordinary)
You got me kissing the ground (Ground) of your sanctuary (Sanctuary)
Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my
World was in black and white until I saw your light
I thought you had to die to find

Somethin' so out of the ordinary
I want you laying me down 'til we're dead and buried
On the edge of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine
The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowin' we found

What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met

I've been thinking of you 
And I've been missing your voice on the other side
And I've been dreaming of you
And I can hear you singing through the Silent Night

Do I bore you?
Or do you want to take me from this crowded place to 
Somewhere we can find some peace and the world is ours to keep
Hmmm

They don't have to know how we touch'
Cause this feeling's all ours
They'd become so loud trying to 
Fix what was never really broken
And you are my safe heaven
I am on your side 

Do you ever feel the need to get away from me?
Do I bore you?
Or do you want to take me from this crowded place to
Somewhere we can find some peace
And the world is ours to keep
Hmmm

In this world, we are fading away
And I'm not fine Sometimes, it gets so lonely
But I'm still scared to ask for help
But I'll look at you the same as today
The one that I've been needing
I never thought I'd have 
I've been thinking of you
And I've been missing your voice on the other side

Do you ever feel the need to get away from me?
Do I bore you?
Or do you want to take me from this crowded place to

Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen
And coughed, and coughed
And then, she came up to my knees
Begging, "Baby, would you please?
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long

She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever
Worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
When you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so that I can see you and I hate to wait so long

And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever until you wanna sit it out`

Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when the sun won't shine
You and me belong together all the time

Spillin' wine and homemade drinks
We throw a cheers, the worries sink
Damnit, it's so good to be alive
We know that we don't got much
But, then again, it's just enough
To always find a way for a good time

You and me belong together
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when the sun won't shine
You and me belong together

This love is all we need
Oh, we've got so much
You and me, oh

Like cold iced tea and warmer weather
Where we lay out late underneath the pines
And we still have fun when the sun won't shine
You and me belong together all the time
